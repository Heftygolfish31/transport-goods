QUICK DELIVERY PARCEL SERVICE
The Quick Delivery Parcel Service was founded in 2015 to deliver parcels to homes and businesses
across South Wales.

The company has established a pricing structure that includes costs to cover the delivery distance,
the size of the parcel and the requested delivery time. Customers can choose from:
• Next day delivery before 1pm
Next day delivery between 8am and 6pm
• Normal delivery (3-5 working days)
There is a 50 pence per mile charge for delivery distances over 20 miles - the first 20 miles are free.


For example, a large parcel being sent from Cardiff to Swansea (40 miles) to arrive the next day
would cost:
• Size charge (from Parcel Table): £27.96
• Distance charge (from Mileage Table): (40 - 20) £0.50 = £10.00
• Total charge = Size charge + Distance charge
•Total charge - £27.96 + £10.00
• Total charge = £37.96

You have been asked to create an application that will allow the user to:
• Enter and store the details of a customer and the parcel they wish to send
• Calculate the total cost of a delivery
• Create and store an invoice for each delivery
• Allow users to recall the details of a delivery and update when a parcel was delivered.
You only need to consider the four locations shown in the table on the next page.

To produce the application, you should:
• analyse the given information
• design a solution to the given problem
• program the solution to the given problem
• test and refine the application, noting the refinements in your refinement log
• evaluate your applicaiton.

Produce a report that includes the sections of work included on the Tasks page. Your report should
be about 2,000 words.
